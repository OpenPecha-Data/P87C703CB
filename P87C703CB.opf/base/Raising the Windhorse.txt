Raising the Windhorse
by Khachöpa

kyé, nöchü jungwa nga yi long
Kyé! The universe and its inhabitants, the expanse of the five elements,
yumchen nga yi tuk ying né
Are the five mothers: from the space of their wisdom mind
khordé lungté lhatsok nam
All you deities of the windhorse, throughout saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
dir shek lungté baden bul
Come, approach! I offer the flag of the windhorse:
nyendrak lungta gyepa dang
Increase our renown, rouse our windhorse, and
yul lé gyalwé trinlé dzö
With your enlightened activity make us victorious over all!
