Brief Windhorse Practice of Tārā
by Patrul Rinpoche

lumé chok sum chi dang jetsünma
Through the blessing and power of the unfailing Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and of Jetsünma,
gyalyum pakma drolmé jin tu yi
Mother of the buddhas, Noble Tārā,
dak gi tsé sö paljor nyendrak nam
May our lifespan, merit, prosperity and renown
yar ngö da dang yar gyi tso shyindu
Increase like a waxing moon, like a rising summer lake.
khyepar khajé wangtang lungta nam
Especially may our good fortune, wangtang and windhorse
nyampa so shying chetü gyelwa long
Be healed when they weaken, rejoined when interrupted, raised up when sinking down;
chi jé lekpé lam du drowa dang
May whatever we do turn out well,
tsering nemé dé dang den gyur chik
And may long life, good health, peace and happiness be ours!

By the one called Abu.
