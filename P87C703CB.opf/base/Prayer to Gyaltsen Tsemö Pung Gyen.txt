↑ Gyaltsen Tsemö Pung Gyen, whose name translates roughly as 'Ornament on the Top of the Victory
Banner', is a female deity whose dhāraṇī is particularly treasured as a method for enhancing
windhorse. The Buddha said that in a previous life he had heard her dhāraṇī, and from
that moment on never again did he experience fear or defeat.↑ Note that this same text
has also been attributed to Jamgön Mipham Rinpoche and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo.
